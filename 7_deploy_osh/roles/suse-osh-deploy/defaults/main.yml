# These variables were created to provide a way for deployers to
# override the default registry, for example to point to a local
# registry. This change will apply to all the charts value files by
# default, as all our own value files are including a common file
# (files/common-images-overrides.yml) making use of those variables.
# Local registry should still have the same groups as upstream registry
# (kolla, openstackhelm), and the same images. Version can be overriden
# with suse_osh_image_version for a global change.
