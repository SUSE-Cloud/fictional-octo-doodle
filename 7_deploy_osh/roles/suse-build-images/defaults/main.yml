# As loci build image logic has issues with secre registry server
# so we are building images on insecure registry server.
# After successful build of infra and service components, we stop
# insecure version and start secure registry in-place and publish images
# to that registry server so that helm charts in caasp cluster can use
# override images hosted on that registry server.
