Base Software
-------------

The following software must be installed on your `Deployer`:

  * ansible>=2.7.0
  * gcc
  * git
  * jq
  * python3-netaddr
  * python-virtualenv

Create SUSE Containerized OpenStack Workspace
---------------------------------------------

All the deployment artifacts are stored in a :term:`workspace`. The workspace
by default is a directory located in the user's home directory on the Deployer.
Create a directory in your home directory that ends in -workspace. Then export
SOCOK8S_ENVNAME=<directory name prefix> to set your workspace. To change your
workspace parent directory, export `SOCOK8S_WORKSPACE_BASEDIR` with the base
directory where your workspace is located.

.. code-block:: console

  mkdir ~/socok8s-workspace
  export SOCOK8S_ENVNAME=socok8s


Cloning repository
-----------------------

To get started, clone the socok8s GitHub repository. This repository uses
submodules, so you need to get all the code to make sure the playbooks work.

::

   git clone --recursive https://github.com/SUSE-Cloud/socok8s.git

Alternatively, one can fetch/update the tree of the submodules by running:

::

   git submodule update --init --recursive


SSH Key Preparation
-------------------

Create an SSH key on the Deployer node, and add the public key to each CaaS
Platform worker node.

.. note ::

  1. To generate the key, you can use ssh-keygen -t rsa

  2. To copy the ssh key to each node, use the ssh-copy-id command,
     for example: ssh-copy-id root@192.168.122.1

  Test this by connecting to the node via SSH and executing a command with ‘sudo’.
  Neither operation should require a password.

Passwordless sudo
-----------------

If installing as a non-root user, you will need to give your user passwordless
sudo on the Deployer.

.. code-block:: console

   sudo visudo

Add the following.

.. code-block:: console

   <username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

Add the above line after "#includedir /etc/sudoers.d". replace <username> with
your username.


Configure Ansible
-----------------

Use ARA (recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ansible Run Analysis (ARA) makes Ansible runs easier to visualize, understand,
and troubleshoot. To use ARA, set the following environment variable before
running `run.sh`.

.. code-block:: console

   export USE_ARA='True'

To set up ARA permanently for your user on `Deployer`, create an Ansible
configuration file loading ARA plugins:

.. code-block:: console

   python -m ara.setup.ansible | tee ~/.ansible.cfg

For more details on the ARA web interface, see
https://ara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/webserver.html.

Enable Mitogen (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve deployment speed, enable the Mitogen strategy and connection plug-in.
First install Mitogen in your venv (e.g. `~/suse-socok8s-deploy/.ansiblevenv/`
or your local Ansible environment), then enable it using environment variables.

Alternatively, enable it for all your Ansible calls by adding it to your
ansible configuration:

.. code-block:: console

   cat << EOF >> ~/.ansible.cfg
   strategy_plugins=${SOCOK8S_WORKSPACE_BASEDIR}/${SOCOK8S_ENVNAME}.ansiblevenv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ansible_mitogen/plugins/strategy
   strategy = mitogen_linear
   EOF

For more details on Mitogen, see
https://mitogen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ansible.html.

Enable Pipelining (recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can improve SSH connections by enabling pipelining:

.. code-block:: console

   cat << EOF >> ~/.ansible.cfg
   [ssh_connection]
   pipelining = True
   EOF


With this done, continue your deployment with the
:ref:`configuredeployment` page.
