For SES deployments that have version 5.5 and higher, there is a Salt runner
that can create all the users and pools OpenStack services require. It also
generates a yaml configuration that is needed to integrate with SUSE
Containerized OpenStack Cloud. The integration runner creates separate users
for Cinder, Cinder backup, and Glance. Both the Cinder and Nova services
will have the same user, as Cinder needs access to create objects that Nova
uses.

Log in as root to run the SES 5.5 Salt runner on the salt admin host.
root #

.. code-block:: bash

  salt-run --out=yaml openstack.integrate prefix=mycloud

The prefix parameter allows pools to be created with the specified prefix.
In this way, multiple cloud deployments can use different users and pools on
the same SES deployment.

The sample yaml output:

After you have run the openstack.integrate runner, copy the yaml into the
ses_config.yml file in the root of the workspace on the Deployer node.
