Installation Overview
=====================

This guide refers to the following types of hosts:

* A `Deployer` with dual roles. It is the starting point for invoking the
  deployment socok8s scripts and Ansible playbooks. And it is the access point
  to your Kubernetes cluster. A deployer can be a continuous integration (CI) node,
  a laptop, or a dedicated VM.
* A series of :term:`CaaS Platform` nodes: `administration node`, `master`, `workers`.
* A series of :term:`SES` nodes.

The following diagram shows the general workflow of a SUSE Containerized
OpenStack deployment on an installed SUSE CaaS Platform cluster and
SUSE Enterprise Storage.

       color = "#EEEEEE"
       label = "Cloud Deployment"
       setup_caasp_workers -> patch_upstream;
       patch_upstream -> build_images;
       build_images -> deploy_airship [folded];
       setup_caasp_workers -> deploy_airship;
       deploy_airship -> deploy_openstack;
     }
   }

Users who do not have SUSE CaaS Platform and SES can still try out the technical
preview. An experimental tool is included to install a minimal SUSE CaaS Platform
cluster and an SES all-in-one (AIO) for bootstrapping the SUSE Containerized
OpenStack deployment. The instructions can be found on the page :ref:`provisioninfra`.
