Welcome to SUSE Containerized OpenStack Technology Preview
==========================================================

The socok8s project automates SUSE Containerized OpenStack provisioning and
lifecycle management on SUSE Container as a Service Platform (CaaSP) and
SUSE Enterprise Storage (SES), using Airship, openStack Helm, shell scripts,
and Ansible playbooks.

As a technology preview, the included features are not supported. They may be
functionally incomplete, unstable or in other ways not suitable for production
use. They are mainly included for customer convenience and give customers a
chance to test new technologies within an enterprise environment.

This release deploys the following set of core OpenStack services:

  * Keystone
  * Glance
  * Cinder
  * Nova
  * Nuetron
  * Heat
  * Horizon

Whether it will be moved to a fully supported product later, depends on customer
and market feedback. A technology preview does not automatically result in
support at a later point in time. It could be dropped at any time and SUSE is not
committed to provide a technology preview later in the product cycle.

Please, give your SUSE representative feedback, including your experience and
use case.
