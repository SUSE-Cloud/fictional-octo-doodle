Base software
-------------

Install the following software on your `localhost`:

  * jq
  * ipcalc
  * git
  * python-virtualenv

Optionally, `localhost` can be preinstalled with the following software:

  * ansible>=2.7.0
  * python-openstackclient
  * python-requests
  * python-jmespath
  * python-openstacksdk
  * python-netaddr

Make sure to install the variant of the packages that matches the Python
release that ansible is using. (e.g. on Tumbleweed, Ansible is using Python 3,
so install the "python3-" variant of the packages)

If those optional software aren't installed, they will be installed in a
venv in `~/.socok8svenv`.

Cloning this repository
-----------------------

To get started, you need to clone this repository. This repository uses
submodules, so you need to get all the code to make sure the playbooks
work.

::

   git clone --recursive https://github.com/SUSE-Cloud/socok8s.git

Alternatively, one can fetch/update the tree of the submodules by
running:

::

   git submodule update --init --recursive

.. _deploymechanism:

Set a deployment mechanism
--------------------------

This tooling can deploy its software on top of OpenStack, KVM, and, in the
future, on bare metal.

This behaviour can be changed by setting the environment variable
`DEPLOYMENT_MECHANISM`.

For example, if you want to bring your own CaaSP/SES cluster, run:

.. code-block:: console

   export DEPLOYMENT_MECHANISM='KVM'

Alternatively, if you want to deploy CaaSP, SES, OpenStack-Helm, and/or Airship
on top of an OpenStack environment (for CI for example), run:

.. code-block:: console

   export DEPLOYMENT_MECHANISM='openstack'

OpenStack is the current default behaviour.

.. _configureopenstackdeploymentmechanism:

Configure OpenStack deployment mechanism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the case you are not bringing your own environment, this socok8s tooling can
deploy CaaSP, SES, and/or a deployer on its own with the help of OpenStack.

Make sure your environment have an openstack client configuration file.
For that, you can create the ``~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml``.

Replace the username and password with your appropriate credentials in
the following example if you are running on engcloud (SUSE employees):

::

   clouds:
     engcloud:
       region_name: CustomRegion
       auth:
         auth_url: https://engcloud.prv.suse.net:5000/v3
         username: foctodoodle # your username here
         password: my-super-secret-password # your password here or add it into secure.yaml
         project_name: cloud
         project_domain_name: default
         user_domain_name: ldap_users
       identity_api_version: 3
       cacert: /usr/share/pki/trust/anchors/SUSE_Trust_Root.crt.pem
   ansible:
     use_hostnames: True
     expand_hostvars: False
     fail_on_errors: True

SUSE Employees, you can access the engcloud web UI at https://engcloud.prv.suse.net/.
For more information, see https://wiki.microfocus.net/index.php/SUSE/ECP.
If you don’t have the SUSE root certificate installed, check
http://ca.suse.de/ , or you can set ``insecure: True`` (not recommended).

Now pre-create your environment. It is convention here to use your username
as part of the name of objects you create.

Create a keypair on engcloud (using either the horizon's web interface or
OpenStack CLI’s ``openstack keypair create``) for accessing the
instances created. Remember the name of this keypair (which appears as
``foctodoodle-key`` in the example below)

Set this for all the following scripts:

.. code-block:: console

   export OS_CLOUD=engcloud # Assuming you followed the example for clouds.yaml
   # Your username plus whatever else you would like, will be used for naming
   # objects you create in the cloud
   export PREFIX=foctodoodle
   # Set the name of the keypair you created
   export KEYNAME=foctodoodle-key
   # Set the name of the subnet you created
   export INTERNAL_SUBNET=${PREFIX}-subnet

Now create a network, a subnet, a router and a connection to the
floating network (you only have to do it once):

.. code-block:: console

   openstack network create ${PREFIX}-net
   openstack subnet create --network ${PREFIX}-net --subnet-range 192.168.100.0/24 ${PREFIX}-subnet
   openstack router create ${PREFIX}-router
   openstack router set --external-gateway floating ${PREFIX}-router
   openstack router add subnet ${PREFIX}-router ${PREFIX}-subnet

Prior to executing scripts, be aware that you may need to do some
cleanup prior to retrying scripts or playbooks should they fail. In some
steps a teardown script is provided to clean up any created resources.
Reconfirming that you’ve done all the previous steps to set up now will
save you some time later.

Configure KVM deployment mechanism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The KVM support is work in progress, and the next step
(`setup_hosts`) cannot run in KVM. Currently, for KVM, only the setup of
airship/osh is supported. Therefore there is no extra task (other than
setting the environment variable, see :ref:`deploymechanism`)
required when running in your own KVM environment.

Configure Ansible
-----------------

Use ARA
~~~~~~~

To use ARA, set the following environment variable before running `run.sh`.

.. code-block:: console

   export USE_ARA='True'

To setup ARA more permanently for your user on `localhost`, create an ansible
configuration file loading ara plugins:

.. code-block:: console

   python -m ara.setup.ansible | tee ~/.ansible.cfg

For more details on ARA's web interface, please read
https://ara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/webserver.html .

Enable mitogen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve deployment speed, enable mitogen strategy and connection plugin.
First install mitogen in your venv (e.g. `~/.socok8svenv/` or your local
ansible environment), then enable it using environment variables.

Alternatively, enable it for all your ansible calls by adding it to your
ansible configuration:

.. code-block:: console

   cat < EOF >> ~/.ansible.cfg
   strategy_plugins=/root/.socok8s/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ansible_mitogen/plugins/strategy
   strategy = mitogen_linear
   EOF

For more details on mitogen, please read
https://mitogen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ansible.html .

Enable pipelining
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might want to improve SSH connections by enabling pipelining:

.. code-block:: console

   cat < EOF >> ~/.ansible.cfg
   [ssh_connection]
   pipelining = True
   EOF
