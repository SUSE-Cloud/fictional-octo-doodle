.. important::

   Skip this step if you are bringing your own :term:`SES`,
   :term:`CaaSP`, and deployer environment (recommended).

Apply these commands if you are running on OpenStack and want to construct
your environment from scratch.

.. warning::

   You must export the right environment variables for `run.sh` to work with
   the `openstack` deployment mechanism. Verify that they are set
   appropriately. See :ref:`configureopenstackdeploymentmechanism`.

In separate steps
-----------------

Create your SES node. The SES All-In-One (AIO) node has the following
requirements:

*  (v)CPU: 6
*  Memory: 16GB
*  Storage: 80GB
*  When SES is deployed as AIO, two additional 60GB storage disks must be added
   to the node for OSD.

Configure SES-AIO:

.. code-block:: console

   ./run.sh deploy_ses

Create the :term:`CaaSP` cluster nodes in the cloud:

.. code-block:: console

   ./run.sh deploy_caasp

Create the deployer node:

.. code-block:: console

   ./run.sh deploy_ccp_deployer

Enroll all the :term:`CaaSP` nodes into their roles (master, admin, and workers):

.. code-block:: console

   ./run.sh enroll_caasp_workers

In a single step
----------------

Alternatively, you can do all of the above in one step:

.. code-block:: console

   ./run.sh setup_hosts
