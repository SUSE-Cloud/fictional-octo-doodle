Base software
-------------

Install the following software on your `localhost`:

  * jq
  * ipcalc
  * git
  * python-virtualenv

Optionally, `localhost` can be preinstalled with the following software:

  * ansible>=2.7.0
  * python/python3-openstackclient
  * python/python3-requests
  * python/python3-jmespath
  * python/python3-openstacksdk
  * python/python3-netaddr

Install the variant of the packages that matches the Python release that Ansible
is using. (for example, on openSUSE Tumbleweed, Ansible uses Python 3, so install
the "python3-" variant of the packages).

If the optional software packages are not installed, they will be installed in a
venv in |socok8s_workspace_default|\ `/.ansiblevenv`.

.. note ::

   The requirements that will be installed in that workspace are:

   .. include :: requirements.txt
      :code:



Cloning this repository
-----------------------

To get started, clone this repository. This repository uses submodules, so you
must get all the code to make sure the playbooks work.

::

   git clone --recursive https://github.com/SUSE-Cloud/socok8s.git

Alternatively, one can fetch/update the tree of the submodules by
running:

::

   git submodule update --init --recursive

Configure Ansible
-----------------

Use ARA (recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use ARA, set the following environment variable before running `run.sh`.

.. code-block:: console

   export USE_ARA='True'

To set up ARA more permanently for your user on `localhost`, create an Ansible
configuration file loading ARA plugins:

.. code-block:: console

   python -m ara.setup.ansible | tee ~/.ansible.cfg

For more details on ARA's web interface, please read
https://ara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/webserver.html .

Enable pipelining (recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can improve SSH connections by enabling pipelining:

.. code-block:: console

   cat << EOF >> ~/.ansible.cfg
   [ssh_connection]
   pipelining = True
   EOF

.. _deploymechanism:

Defining a workspace
--------------------

`socok8s` can create a :term:`workspace`, install things (eg. Ansible in a
virtualenv), or create resources (for example, OpenStack Heat stacks if the
deployment mechanism is `openstack`). For all of these operations, an
environment variable called `SOCOK8S_ENVNAME` must be set. This variable must
be unique if multiple environments are installed in parallel.

.. code-block:: console

   export SOCOK8S_ENVNAME='soc-west'


Set the deployment mechanism
----------------------------

The SUSE Containerized OpenStack tooling can work with two different mechanisms:

* Bring your own environment
* Deploy everything on top of OpenStack (experimental).

This behavior can be changed by setting the environment variable
`DEPLOYMENT_MECHANISM`. Its default value is "kvm". When you want
to deploy :term:`CaaSP`, :term:`SES`, and Containerized OpenStack on top of an
OpenStack environment (for CI for example), run:

.. code-block:: console

   export DEPLOYMENT_MECHANISM='openstack'

.. _configureopenstackdeploymentmechanism:

Configure OpenStack deployment mechanism (experimental)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your environment must have an OpenStack client configuration file. For that,
create the ``~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml`` file.

The following is an example if you are running on an "engcloud":

::

   clouds:
     engcloud:
       region_name: CustomRegion
       auth:
         auth_url: https://keystone_url/v3
         username: john # your username here
         password: my-super-secret-password # your password here or add it into secure.yaml
         project_name: cloud
         project_domain_name: default
         user_domain_name: ldap_users # this is just an example, adapt to your needs
       identity_api_version: 3
   ansible:
     use_hostnames: True
     expand_hostvars: False
     fail_on_errors: True

Now pre-create your environment. The convention here is to use your username
as part of the name of objects you create.

Create a keypair on your cloud (named further *engcloud*) using either the
Horizon web interface or the OpenStackClient (OSC) ``openstack keypair create``
command for accessing the instances created. Remember the name of this keypair
(which appears as ``soc-west-key`` in the example below).

Set this for **all** the following scripts in a deployment:

.. code-block:: console

   export SOCOK8S_ENVNAME='soc-west'
   # 'engcloud' is the name in the `clouds.yaml`
   export OS_CLOUD=engcloud
   # Set to the name of the keypair you created
   export KEYNAME=soc-west-key
   #replace with the actual external network name in your OpenStack environment
   export EXTERNAL_NETWORK=floating

Proceed to next section of the documentation,
:ref:`ose-targethosts`.
