     localhost -> configure_deployment[folded];

     group {

     }

     configure_deployment -> setup_caasp_workers;

     group {
       color = "#EEEEEE"
       label = "OpenStack deployment"
       setup_caasp_workers -> deploy, patch_upstream [folded];
       patch_upstream -> build_images;
       build_images -> deploy;
     }
   }

All the files for the deployment are in a :term:`workspace`, whose default location
is |socok8s_workspace_default| on `localhost`.
The default name can be changed via the environment variable `SOCOK8S_ENVNAME`

This workspace is structured like an `ansible-runner` directory. It contains:

* an `inventory` folder
* an `env` folder.

This folder must also contain extra files necessary for the deployment, such as
the `ses_config.yml` and the `kubeconfig` files.

Configure the inventory
-----------------------

If you are bringing your own cluster, create an inventory based on our
example located in the `examples` folder.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/workdir/inventory/hosts.yml

This inventory only contains the group names.

For each group, a `hosts:` key must be added, with, as value, each
of the hosts you will need. For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   caasp-admin:
     hosts:
       my_user-57997-admin-x6sugiws4g34:
         ansible_host: 10.86.1.144

See also
`Ansible Inventory Hosts and Groups
<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.7/user_guide/intro_inventory.html#hosts-and-groups>`_.

.. tip::

   Do not add `localhost` as a host in your inventory. It is a host specially
   considered by Ansible. If you want to create an inventory node for your local
   machine, add your machine's hostname inside your inventory, and specify this
   host variable: **ansible_connection: local**

Make the SES pools known by Ansible
-----------------------------------

Ansible relies on two things to know the :term:`SES` pools created for the
Airship/OpenStack deployment:

* a `ses_config.yml` file present in the workspace
* the ceph admin keyring, in base64, present in the file `env/extravars` of
  your workspace.

You can find an example `ses_config.yml` in `examples/workdir`.

Configure the VIP that will be used for OpenStack service public endpoints
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add `socok8s_ext_vip:` with its appropriate value for your environment in your
`env/extravars`. This should be an available IP on the external network
(in a development environment, it can be the same as a CaaSP cluster network).

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   socok8s_ext_vip: "10.10.10.10"


Configure the VIP that will be used for Airship UCP service endpoints
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Add `socok8s_dcm_vip:` with its appropriate value for your environment in your
`env/extravars`. This should be an available IP on the data center management
(DCM) network (in a development environment, it can be the same as a CaaSP
cluster network).

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   socok8s_dcm_vip: "192.168.51.35"

Provide a kubeconfig file
-------------------------

socok8s relies on kubectl and Helm commands to configure your OpenStack
deployment. You must provide a `kubeconfig` file on your `localhost` in
your workspace. You can fetch this file from the Velum UI on your
CaaSP cluster.


Advanced configuration
----------------------

socok8s deployment variables respect Ansible general precedence. All the
variables can be adapted.

You can override most user facing variables with host vars and group vars.

.. note ::

   You can also use extravars, as they always win. extravars can be used to
   override any deployment code.
   Use it at your own risk.

socok8s is flexible and allows you to override the value of any upstream Helm
chart value with appropriate overrides.

.. note ::

   Please read the page :ref:`userscenarios` for inspiration on overrides.
